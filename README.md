# BreakTheWallHBOOpdracht

Old Java project, but it does still compile. 

To run this project, open Eclipse (or any other Java compatible ide), import the project. Then select the "/src/main/java/core" package, and run as "Java Applictation".

Use the arrow keys to move the shield, spacebar to fire your powerup and left ctrl to pause the game.

There are still a few collision issues, but I won't put any time in these. Using HAN's game engine.
